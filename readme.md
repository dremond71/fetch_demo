# Fetch API Demo Application

## Setup

```sh
npm install
```

## Start the server

```sh
npm start
```

## Try out different API

Open your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8081/index.html">http://localhost:8081/index.html</a>

Try out different calls; some with deliberate errors and some without.

`index.html` imports the script file `myscripts.js` which contains
the different functions used in `index.html` .

Right-click index.html to open up the developer console, click on Sources tab, select myscripts.js, and put a breakpoint in one of the functions.

Then in the browser, click on the appropriate button to call that function.
